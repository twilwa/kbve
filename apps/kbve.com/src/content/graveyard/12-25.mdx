## Notes

- Merry X Mas!

### 2023

- 6:15am - I am a bit sad that there isn't any snow! Actually it was pretty weird to walk around in almost 50 degree weather.

- 9:45am - Next step would be to setup the ULIDs for the tables. Part of this will be to make sure that I have sanitization in place ahead of time before migrating over.

- 11:51am - There were a couple cool XMas gifts that I have gotten but the one from my uncle and another from a close friend have been amazing.
    I can not yet talk about the one that uncle gave me, but my close friend gifted me a crypto puzzle! I am still trying to resolve it but its a dope concept.
    This could easily become a cool side hustle for future gifts too. 

- 4:49pm - Here is the migration to `ULID` via Drizzle, `ulid: binary('ulid', { length: 16}).primaryKey().notNull(),`.
    Hmm, I will take a bit of a break from programming and chill out for the rest of the day.
    I been spending way too much time trying to solve this art piece to focus on anything else.
