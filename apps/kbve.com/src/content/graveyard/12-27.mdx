## Notes

### 2023

- 10:23am - Currently at a work meeting but inbetween the ARM talks, I figured I would test case the ULID integrations.

- 10:29am - Adding the `ULID` crate and added a quick shell code, `./kbve.sh -db` to help generate the model, schema and patching.

- 11:29am - I should go back and clean up the whole `kbve` package to be a bit more straight forward.
    The new package for `kbve` will be split into three main modules, they will be `utility.rs`, `guild.rs`, and `spellbook.rs`.
    I will place the all the macros within the spellbook.rs.
    Then under the utility, I will migrate all the helper, harden , db ect.. to a central location.
    Finally the guild.rs will hold majority of the functions. I will try to keep the structures within the guild.rs

- 4:22pm - Was able to merge the `helper.rs` into the `utility.rs` and now I am double checking the `harden.rs` as will try to migrate that as well.

- 6:35pm - Watching a bit of Firefly and then going to end the night playing some DnD! ThorSoul LagerShield, Son of Odin.
