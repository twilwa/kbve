## Notes

### 2023

- 7:40am - I had an interesting shower thought, I should turn some of the homebrew items from yesterday's DnD as custom items.
    This way they can be referenced in the future and we can expand upon them.
    Also it would give the items some fancy artwork to go along with it too.

- 3:03pm - After spending some time working, I am planning to finish up the `ULID` migrations by this weekend.

- 6:29pm - Building out the rust graveyard for some of the older codebase, as I begin to migrate the API package to a new version.
