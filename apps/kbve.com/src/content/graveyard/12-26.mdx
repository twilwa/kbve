## Notes

The day before long resting until the next year?

### 2023

- 4:45am - I got up way too early, I am just going to watch some videos and see if I can fall back to sleep.

- 11:00am - I might have messed up my sleep and also found out that no one was this meeting, it seems people are either sick or taken that long vacation until next year.

- 3:42pm - I am preparing the ULID migration of the database.
    I am currently looking into how I should be dealing with relations and references within the new database schema.
    Swapping out all the `serial(id)` and then trunning a couple benchmarks to see how it will perform.

- 5:05pm - Database migration is always a pain but I understand why, because if its done wrong, it can break the whole database xD
    ```sql

    ALTER TABLE `apikey` DROP COLUMN `id`;
    ALTER TABLE `apikey` DROP COLUMN `uuid`;
    ALTER TABLE `appwrite` DROP COLUMN `id`;
    ALTER TABLE `appwrite` DROP COLUMN `uuid`;
    ALTER TABLE `auth` DROP COLUMN `id`;
    ALTER TABLE `auth` DROP COLUMN `uuid`;
    ALTER TABLE `n8n` DROP COLUMN `id`;
    ALTER TABLE `n8n` DROP COLUMN `uuid`;
    ALTER TABLE `profile` DROP COLUMN `id`;
    ALTER TABLE `profile` DROP COLUMN `uuid`;
    ALTER TABLE `settings` DROP COLUMN `id`;
    ALTER TABLE `settings` DROP COLUMN `uuid`;
    ALTER TABLE `users` DROP COLUMN `id`;

    ```
- 7:51pm - Extending out the Diesel_CLI through the `kbve.sh` shell file.
