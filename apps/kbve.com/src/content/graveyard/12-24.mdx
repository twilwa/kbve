## Notes

- Eve of XMas!

### 2023

- 11:36am - Going to take a shot at Ubuntu Chisel again this morning!

- 2:35pm - Made some decent progress with the Chisel image and I am starting to get the hang of it. 
    The idea here is to help shrink and remove any extra files being used by Ubuntu and have a smaller docker image for portability.


- 6:43pm - Even after completing the base of a functional chisel, there are a couple additional `slices` that I have to write, these are important in making sure that `libmysqlclient` can run without any problems.
    I was thinking of swapping out Diesel with SQLX for a pure rust build but upon benchmarking and test casing, it seems the MySQL written in pure Rust is a bit slower than the C library so it might not be worth it for now.

- 7:40pm - Wrapping up the day with publishing the chisel image onto the Docker repo. The next phase in this plan will be to deploy it via Fly.io but I need to resolve a couple other issues before I do that, including migrating the primary keys.
