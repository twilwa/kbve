## Notes

### 2024

It will be officially a year from this date! WoW!

### 2023

- I am running into weird issues with Astro 2.3.0, going to delay the upgrade until I can resolve them.

- Started to make a Windows 11 template for the RSPS Project,  but damn it seems to be a pain to get it all optimized and secure.

- Should we keep raw daily notes? Or would it be too much information? Hmmm.

- While I am in India, I just finished setting up my NR accounts, it feels interesting being a dual citizen. The idea that I can be on the other side of the world and live a completely different life style.

- It was a bumper to see Starship flight get scrubbed.

- Damn really had to put quotes on the title to avoid the YAML error.

The error is here:

```ini
7:18:30 PM: [astro:content-imports] can not read a block mapping entry; a multiline key may not be an implicit key
7:18:30 PM: file: /opt/build/repo/src/content/_bin/_daily.md?astroContent=true:4:4

I had to wrap the title inside quotes to help with the mapping. >.>
