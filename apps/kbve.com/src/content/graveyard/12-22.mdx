## Notes

### 2023

- 6:35am - Running into Bell during the nightshift migration! YuGiOh playing in the background, tis the perfect random anime to have in the early mornings.

- 7:38am - Had to take a break taking digital daily notes but I kept written notes, journals and logs of everything.
  I will have to parse through all the written notes, but hopefully it won't be too painful.

- 9:00am - Preparing for the Obsidian note migration! There will be a decent amount of cleaning up to do, including converting over the journals from markdown to MDX.

- 4:25pm - Started the research and development of the Flutter , Rust and WASM concept! There are a couple issues that I have noticed, this includes how to handle the FFI.
  We could just utilize the WASM as the base but I am thinking that might end up becoming overkill for some of the concepts that we are currently building and instead stick with a base level of integration.

- 7:42pm - The other area that I want to focus on is getting the monorepo to start patching itself, this will be very basic in the begin but I want to expand upon it sooner than later.
  The self patching concept would eventually extend out to utilize AutoGen but for now just getting the basic CI/CD out of the way would make sense.
  Example test cases would be resolving prettier issues or building embedables and placing them into distribution, with pre-compressed options.
