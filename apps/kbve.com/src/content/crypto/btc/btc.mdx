## Information

Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency based upon a SHA-256 blockchain.
The concept was created in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto's white paper, which was a document that outlined a decentralized digital currency that operated through a peer-to-peer network.
The blockchain-based currency was launched in 2009 through a gensis block with a public and open source codebase.
Further blocks within the chain are created through mining, which is a process of hashing data under the term of `proof-of-work`.
