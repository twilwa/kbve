## Information

XSS, known as, Cross Site Scripting, is the act of injecting malicious script, usually javascript, into a website with the attempt to hi-jack information and/or alter the underlying production code. Examples include stealing client information, bypassing WAFs/filters and redirecting client (user, staff, entity) to unauthorized locations.

OWASP breaks XSS into 3 types, defined below:

-   Reflected XSS - Non-Presistent - Type 1

-   Stored XSS - Persistent - Type 2

-   DOM Based XSS - Type 3 (as referenced as Type 0)

---

## Attacks

Common XSS attack vectors are split into throw main categories.

### ATO

ATO - Hostile Account Takeover.

### Cookie Manipulation

Cookie Manipulation - Obtaining another client's cookie.

### DOM Replacement

DOM Replacement - Swapping (Persistent/Non-Presistent) Document Object Model (HTML) with a hostile/malignment node (DOM-entity, Memory HTML).

## Defense

The best defense is to assume every form of client (user, staff, entity, personal) has a malicious intent and should be sanitized at the client and server side. Sanitization encompasses a combination of filtering and encoding, as well as, referencing libraries as tools. The only draw back with heavy filtering / encoding will be performance but its a trade-off worth the safety of the data, client and server.

-   Encode: - Unicode-escape sequence is a string that starts with a backlash, `\`, followed by the letter `u` and 4 hexadecimal digits. - The backlash, `\` , acts as the `UnicodeEscape`. - The letter, `u`, acts as the `UnicodeMarker`. - The 4 digits are referenced as hexDigits: - `0` , `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`, `F`. - Examples: - `<` -> UnicodeEscape() -> `\u003c` - `>` -> UnicodeEscape() -> `\u003e` - HTML Entities - - Examples: - `<` -> HTML_Entities() -> `&lt;` || `&#60;` - `>` -> HTML_Entities() -> `&gt;` || `&#62;` - `&` -> HTML_Entities() -> `&amp;` || `&#38;`
