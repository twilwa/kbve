## Information

---

## Install

**On Linux or MacOS or (WSL on Windows)**:

-   [According to Chapter 1.1 from the Official Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch01-01-installation.html) to install rust you can use the following script:

-   Command to install via `curl`

    -   ```shell
        curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.3 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
        ```

    -> The command downloads a script and starts the installation of the `rustup` tool, which installs the latest stable version of Rust. You might be prompted for your password. If the installation is successful, the following line will appear:
    -> `Rust is installed now. Great!`

    -   You will also need a _linker_, which is a program that Rust uses to join its compiled outputs into one file. It is likely you already have one. If you get linker errors, you should install a C compiler...

**On Windows**:

-   [Reference the Book's Chapter 1.1 'Installing `rustup` on Windows' section](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch01-01-installation.html#installing-rustup-on-windows)

---

## Update

    - Incase we need to update rust to the latest stable version, we will use `rustup` to update, via this command in shell:

        ```shell
            rustup update
        ```


---

## Cargo

    > TLDR; Cargo is a package manager for Rust that handles the dependencies, compiling and distribution. Cargo can publish your package to `crates.io` so that it can be used with other applications within Rust.

    To get started with Cargo, see if you have Cargo installed via running `cargo` with the help flag:

    -   ```shell
        cargo help
        ```
        -   For `ubuntu` you might need to run `sudo cargo help`.

    ### Rust Cargo-Watch

        -   #### Watch

            -   Cargo-Watch will watch over the current project's source code for changes and then run Cargo commands when they occur.
            -   This will make building and development easier!

        -   #### Watch Install

            -   To install the cargo-watch, run this command below in shell on the dev operating system.

                -   ```shell
                    cargo install cargo-watch
                    ```

        -   ### Watch Terms

            -   The default cargo watch that we are currently using is:

                -   ```shell
                    cargo watch -q -c -x run
                    ```

## Guides

-   [The Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/title-page.html)

    > (From the Official Rust Lang Website)
    > This book assumes that youâ€™ve written code in another programming language but doesnâ€™t
    > make any assumptions about which one. Weâ€™ve tried to make the material broadly accessible
    > to those from a wide variety of programming backgrounds. We donâ€™t spend a lot of time talking
    > about what programming is or how to think about it. If youâ€™re entirely new to programming, you
    > would be better served by reading a book that specifically provides an introduction to programming.

-   [A Gentle Introduction to Rust](https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/)

    > The aim of this tutorial is to take you to a place where you can read and write enough Rust to
    > fully appreciate the excellent learning resources available online, in particular
    > [The Book.](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/title-page.html)
    > It's an opportunity to try before you buy, and get enough feeling for the power of the language to want to go deeper.

-   [Rust ðŸ¦€ and WebAssembly ðŸ•¸](https://rustwasm.github.io/book/)

    > This small book describes how to use Rust and WebAssembly together.

-   [Cookin' with Rust](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/intro.html)

    > This Rust Cookbook is a collection of simple examples that demonstrate good practices to accomplish common
    > programming tasks, using the crates of the Rust ecosystem.

## Examples

    -   These are some examples of repos, demos, and source code written in rust!

    ### MicroService

        This is a quick repo / guide on a Rust MySQL Microservice!

        -   Official [Repo](https://github.com/second-state/microservice-rust-mysql)

    ### Youki

        Youki is an Open Container Initiative runtime specification library written in Rust.

        Official [Youki Repo](https://github.com/containers/youki)

        There are some issues with some devices within `CGroups v2` that should be noted.

        Since youki is a low-level runtime, its recommend that you combine it with a high-level runtime, such as Docker / Podman.

---

## Web

-   There are a couple options for running a HTTP server in Rust.

-   ### Axum

    -   Axum is an ergonomic and modular Rust web application framework.
    -   [Github Repo](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum)
    -   Axum can be extended through Tower, which is an ecosystem of middleware, services and utilities

## Egui

    -   This crate is a user-friendly, easy-to-integrate, immediate-mode GUI library designed for rapid development of interactive applications in Rust.

    ### Egui Deps

        -   There are some dependencies that you might require when working with `egui`:

            ```shell
            sudo apt-get install libxcb-render0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libxkbcommon-dev libssl-dev
            ```
                - Note: These dependencies are for Ubuntu / WSL.

        -   Making sure the `rustup` has the `wasm` components.

            ```shell
            rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknow
            ```
        
        -   Installing `Trunk`

            ```shell
            cargo install --locked trunk
            ```
