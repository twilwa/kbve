## Cheatsheet

The ADB cheatsheet provides a general list of basic commands for Android operating system and applications.
Please note that certain commands require the device to be rooted, furthermore certain Android versions may require a tweak to the commands.

You can use ADB shell commands to perform actions such as changing the resolution of your device display, uninstalling bloatware or system apps, enabling and disabling features, modifying the system files, ect..
