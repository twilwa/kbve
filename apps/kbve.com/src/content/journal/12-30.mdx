## Notes

### 2023

- 12:31pm - The year is about to be over and it has been an amazing adventure, the skills and confidence that I have gained within Rust, Unity and a couple other languages has been majestic.

- 12:41pm - Preparing for the C Panda Playground! I am thinking we could do a couple cool test examples, maybe even a random dice roller for DnD?
    I am sure it might be a bit harder than it seems but we shall see!

- 12:47pm - The older `pub async fn hazardous_create_user` was a simple function that would insert a new username and the only change we have to make is the ULID generation.
    Before we had the database generate the UUID but this can cause issues when having multiple databases, definitely in the virtual replications.
    To offset that problem, we will create the ULID and insert it via the hazardous function!
    However we have to be very careful because we are dealing with a `hazardous` function, which can open us up to a SQL Injection.

    Here is the older function, as a reference point.

    ```rust

        pub async fn hazardous_create_user(
        clean_username: String,
        pool: Arc<Pool>
    ) -> Result<bool, &'static str> {
        let mut conn = kbve_get_conn!(pool);

        match
            insert_into(users::table)
                .values((
                    users::username.eq(clean_username),
                    users::role.eq(0), // Setting role to 0
                    users::reputation.eq(0), // Setting reputation to 0
                    users::exp.eq(0), // Setting exp to 0
                    users::created_at.eq(Utc::now().naive_utc()), // Setting current UTC time
                ))
                .execute(&mut conn)
        {
            Ok(_) => Ok(true),
            Err(_) => Err("Failed to insert user into database"),
        }
    }

    ```

    The first thing we will do is update the macro to use the one from our spellbook.
    So we will change the `let mut conn = kbve_get_conn!(pool);` to `let mut conn = spellbook_pool_conn!(pool);`.
    This is just to make it easier for future developers to understand that it is a macro from the `spellbook.rs` file.

    Next we have to just slightly update the function to add the `ulid` but before we do that, we have to create the `ulid`.
    We will be using the `ulid` crate, so make sure that it is installed via Cargo and then add it to the top of the file.
    In our case, it is the `guild.rs` , which is just a simple line, `use ulid::Ulid;`
    Actually, now that I am thinking about it. We would be better off creating a function within the `utility.rs` that would generate ULIDs for us.
    So actually, we would move the usage of the crate, `use ulid:Ulid;` out of the `guild.rs` and place it inside of the `utility.rs`.
    
    Now inside of the utility file, we will create two functions.
    
    ```rust
    
    pub fn generate_ulid_as_bytes() -> Vec<u8> {
	let ulid = Ulid::new();
	ulid.to_bytes().to_vec()
    }

    pub fn generate_ulid_as_string() -> String {
	let ulid = Ulid::new();
	ulid.to_string()
    }
    
    ```
    
    Now that we got the function to generate ULID as bytes/string.
    Let us go ahead and add them into the spellbook, as macros.

    ```rust
    
    #[macro_export]
    macro_rules! spellbook_generate_ulid_bytes {
        () => {
            {
                // Call the generate_ulid_as_bytes function
                crate::utility::generate_ulid_as_bytes()
            }
        };
    }

    #[macro_export]
    macro_rules! spellbook_generate_ulid_string {
        () => {
            {
                // Call the generate_ulid_as_string function
                crate::utility::generate_ulid_as_string()
            }
        };
    }
    ```

    Then we will update our `hazardous_create_user` function with the new ULID.
    Here is how it would look!

    ```rust
        pub async fn hazardous_create_user(
        clean_username: String,
        pool: Arc<Pool>
    ) -> Result<bool, &'static str> {
        let mut conn = spellbook_pool_conn!(pool);

        let clean_ulid = spellbook_generate_ulid_bytes!();

        match
            insert_into(users::table)
                .values((
                    users::ulid.eq(clean_ulid), // Adding the clean ulid!
                    users::username.eq(clean_username),
                    users::role.eq(0), // Setting role to 0
                    users::reputation.eq(0), // Setting reputation to 0
                    users::exp.eq(0), // Setting exp to 0
                    users::created_at.eq(Utc::now().naive_utc()), // Setting current UTC time
                ))
                .execute(&mut conn)
        {
            Ok(_) => Ok(true),
            Err(_) => Err("Failed to insert user into database"),
        }
    }

    ```

- 1:40pm - The next step in the migration will be for the `task_fetch_userid_by_username` function.
    This function was using the u64 as the main reference point, so all we had to do was swap out that with a `Vec<u8>`.
    Furthermore, I added an additional macro, called `spellbook_internal_username` which is a place holder for internal macro calls.

    Now the next migration is for the `hazardous_create_auth_from_ulid` function.
    We will be saving the user`s ulid instead of the u64 but we also have to create a new ulid for the auth row itself.

    For the migration, I added this line:
    `let clean_auth_ulid = spellbook_generate_ulid_bytes!();`
    and updated the insert_into values to include both the auth ulid and user ulid.
    Final migration function looks a bit like this:

    ```rust

        pub async fn hazardous_create_auth_from_ulid(
        clean_hash_password: String,
        clean_email: String,
        clean_user_ulid: Vec<u8>,
        pool: Arc<Pool>
    ) -> Result<bool,  &'static str> {

        let mut conn = spellbook_pool_conn!(pool);

        let clean_auth_ulid = spellbook_generate_ulid_bytes!();

        match
        insert_into(auth::table)
            .values((
                auth::ulid.eq(clean_auth_ulid),
                auth::userid.eq(clean_user_ulid),
                auth::email.eq(clean_email),
                auth::hash.eq(clean_hash_password),
                auth::salt.eq("0"),
                auth::password_reset_token.eq("0"),
                auth::password_reset_expiry.eq(Utc::now().naive_utc()),
                auth::verification_token.eq("0"),
                auth::verification_expiry.eq(Utc::now().naive_utc()),
                auth::status.eq(0),
                auth::last_login_at.eq(Utc::now().naive_utc()),
                auth::failed_login_attempts.eq(0),
                auth::lockout_until.eq(Utc::now().naive_utc()),
                auth::two_factor_secret.eq("0"),
                auth::recovery_codes.eq("0"),
            ))
            .execute(&mut conn)
        {
            Ok(_) => Ok(true),
            Err(_) => Err("Failed to create auth row for user"),
        }
    }


    ```

    There is an issue with the spellbook_internal_username that I need to remedy, its definitely something stupid but I will continue migrating over the hazardous functions.

- 1:55pm - Next migration will be for the `hazardous_create_profile_from_ulid`.
    This function will be the same type of migration as the auth, just adding the ULID to the functions.

- 2:40pm - After the general core inserts are done, we have to migrate some of the checks and balances, including handling the ULID conversions.
    We know that within the database, the ULIDs are stored as binary but there are situations where the application stores the ULID as a base32 string, thus we need to convert them.
    Going back to the `utility.rs`, we can add this function to help 

    ```rust

        pub fn convert_ulid_string_to_bytes(ulid_str: &str) -> Result<Vec<u8>, String> {
        match Ulid::from_str(ulid_str) {
            Ok(ulid) => Ok(ulid.to_bytes().to_vec()),
            Err(_) => Err("Invalid ULID string".to_string()),
        }
    }

    ```

    The first area that we run into this migration would be inside of the JWTs.

    Added the conversion before the Diesel exectuion and looks pretty good so far!

    
- 2:58pm - Cleaning up a couple minor problems with the ULIDs!

- 10:05pm - Wrapping up the ULID conversions and was able to update the API without any specific down time!
    The next stage will be then to update the API with specific functions, such as updating the profiling.

- 10:19pm -
