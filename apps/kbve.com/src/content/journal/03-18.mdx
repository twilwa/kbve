## Notes

</MDXJS>

<MDXJS>

### 2024

<MDXJS>

#### Multiplayer

I decided to take a short break from the pathing issue and look at how I would want to implement a multiplayer.
We know that the discord embed sdk comes out today!

#### Colyseus

I am going to start the test casing for the Colyseus example and get a general test case out there for production.

The start of these notes will be within this [repo](https://github.com/discord/embedded-app-sdk/tree/main/examples/react-colyseus) for start of the project.

So the outline of the App stack would be like this:

- React
- Phaser
- Colyseus

Plugins: 

- Enabled3D , this being optional.
- Grid Engine, this being optional.

#### Embed

The Discord Embed App Pitch 2024 starts within a month, but they are doing a small `buildathon` this week!
I am thinking that it would make sense to first go through the `buildathon` and make a moch application, this will help us debug any issues that might come up during the pitch.

I am going to write out the notes and think about how I should prepare and deploy the `Wumpus Wumbo party` an the first test case for the jam and using that as the test case. This includes loading any and all of the "abstractions".
During this process, I noted that the pathing is not working as expected, but it seems that Discord uses a reverse proxy for the pathing of the assets.
