## Notes

<MDXJS>

### 2024

<MDXJS>

#### Git

The branch is out of sync, going to try and get it back into sync.

This is a test to see if I blew through the cache on github actions.

It was github! Ugh! They were causing all my issues from their endpoint, oh well its been resolved.

#### Supabase

Now back to the main setup and usage of Supabase!

After working through all the specs, I decided that I will hold off on the Supabase integration once more.

This time it is less of the postgres issues but I currently do not have enough resources to actually execute what I need, the revenue stream is not high enough to justify the amount that I would be burning on API calls.
