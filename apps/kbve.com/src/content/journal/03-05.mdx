### 2024

<MDXJS>

#### Bento

Getting the core demo of the bento grid as a template to render within the website.
This took way too much time to resolve, I believe the amount of nested components / files made the process of debugging a bit painful.

We were able to get the general bento grid to render, which is a win for us, but we still need to get the basic react children nodes to render.

I am currently in the process of adding the `html-react-parser` and this should help us in both this bento grid and in Phaser.

The build process looks like it is working, but it seems that I am still having some issues with the `html-react-parser`!
Let me try a different approach because this seems to be a bit broken and I am not feeling it.

#### React

Github [Issue Ticket - #880](https://github.com/KBVE/kbve/issues/880)

The reference is probably the most important part of the example, this should make it easier to extend out the components within Phaser.

#### FishChip

Chippy fixed the displayCombo aspect for the mini gamejam!

I also help chip get onboarded for the whole monorepo, which is another huge win!

We can now expand and build more abstract applications without having to switch around in multiple repos.
