## Notes

### 2024

#### WS

I started to note out the socketio integration for the phaser engine.
The goal here would be shift state management from client side to a hybrid model, allowing some more complex setups for the state.

One concept that I was thinking about earlier would be having live `WPM` competition amoung players, a bit similar to a fishing contest.

The other aspect would be to extend the KBVE site and the leaderboard concept, having some level of data would be great.

#### Characters

I also want to expand upon the characters and the lore related to them.
We have two NPCs right now but they are just there as placeholders and lack a decent level of depth that would matter.

Preparing their back story, goals and general vibe within the Fish&Chip world is important, as it falls into the whole storyboard arc, but I want there to be a bit more chaos than structure.

Placing a form of structure would make sense on any authority or villain arch, but the random NPCs should have chaos built into their blood, or well code.

#### Build

It would make the most sense to prepare the build path for the Phaser game.
We will have the build be within the Alpha branch!

Lets open up the `ci-alpha.yml` and then make changes there for the build.
The first step would be to check for file changes, via ` reactfishchip: ${{ steps.delta.outputs.reactfishchip_any_changed }} `.
Then we would run a build, `pnpm nx build react-phaser-fish-chip`.
We should also grab the logs and cache misses from the nx.app runs but that will be a future note.

Damn I was mistaken, I need to place the build into the `ci-beta` branch instead, so I will migrate the changes over to the beta.
An additional error that I noticed was that we would have to update the commands for the actual
