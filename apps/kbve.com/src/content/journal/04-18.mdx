## Notes

### 2023

@h0lybyte

- Went to the hospital for my yearly check up and it was an interesting system. So I pay around 1000R and get a "full body" checkup, from almost every major medical branch. It was a bit time consuming, about less than 2 hours in total but it was definitely better than having to schedule a bunch of different doctors. Furthermore, since they all work in the same hospital, they could give secondary reviews and be able to cross-pin among different areas of a concern. I will try to make a quick reference about this for anyone that might want to do medical tourism within Gujarat, India.

- After the hopsital trip, I did a casual photo shoot at Sonia Studio and it was magical. First time experiencing the depth that a photographer goes to get the best shot of a person, besides just the angles, lights and timing. Will I ever want to do modeling again in the future? Nah. Was it fun? Yup and for many other reasons as well.

- Now its about 1pm and I decided to meet up with a local and chill at his work. He basically runs a safety & maintainece company for a buddy of his
