## Notes

### 2024

#### Unity

After finishing up my morning work session, I am going to continue working on my the unity game! Ugh character selection and the character handler, oh boy.

This is how our Engine Initalizer looks right now:

```c#

using KBVE.Services;
using UnityEngine;

namespace KBVE.Engine
{
  public class EngineInitializer : MonoBehaviour
  {
    void Awake()
    {
      InitializeServices();
    }

    private void InitializeServices()
    {
      DontDestroyOnLoad(gameObject);

      var servicesInstance = KBVE.Services.Services.Instance;

      //  Register AuthenticationService
      var authService = gameObject.AddComponent<AuthenticationService>();
      servicesInstance.RegisterService<IAuthenticationService>(authService);

      //  Register SceneLoaderService
      var sceneLoaderService = gameObject.AddComponent<SceneLoaderService>();
      servicesInstance.RegisterService<ISceneLoaderService>(sceneLoaderService);

      //  Register UserDataService
      var userDataService = gameObject.AddComponent<UserDataService>();
      servicesInstance.RegisterService<IUserDataService>(userDataService);

      //  Register APIRequestService
      var apiService = gameObject.AddComponent<APIRequestService>();
      servicesInstance.RegisterService<IAPIRequestService>(apiService);

      //  Register CameraService
      var cameraService = gameObject.AddComponent<CameraService>();
      servicesInstance.RegisterService<ICameraService>(cameraService);

      //  Register Weather
      var weatherService = gameObject.AddComponent<WeatherService>();
      servicesInstance.RegisterService<IWeatherService>(weatherService);
    }
  }
}

```

The current design plan is a hybrid of service oriented architecture and event driven architecture.
We split the two types into different namespaces, `KBVE.Services` and `KBVE.Events`, SOA vs EDA!

To add a service on the Initalizer, we just throw in these two lines, for example adding the Entity Service.

```c#

  //  Register EntityService
  var entityService = gameObject.AddComponent<EntityService>();
  servicesInstance.RegisterService<IEntityService>(entityService);

```

Next we need to register the clock service, which will represent the global tick.


```c#

  //  Register ClockService
  var clockService = gameObject.AddComponent<ClockService>();
  servicesInstance.RegisterService<IClockService>(clockService);
```

I believe we have enough of the base services to move forward with the StartZone!

Before I get started on the next update, I want to make sure everything builds and that the rolling updates via the cicd pipeline works.
We will move everything up from the `alpha` branch to the `beta` branch, after it builds, we can then shift it up to `main` for a release.

Over the weekend, I was trying to test case multi agents working on the repo, there were some minor issues regarding them not isolating the changes and throwing a ton of git diffs.
Uhh, long story short, either I need to find a way to resolve the git cherry picks OR really isolate the agents on where they can work, which needs to be done automatically as well.

I am thinking that we we could also move the `KBVE` namespace into its own nuget package and then call it within our application, but that will be for a later time.

The character section could be split into a couple different components, hmm, thinking it through, it might make more sense

#### AutoReview

During the pipeline roll out, it seems that the auto review passed on 3 of the test cases but faild on the remaining 7.

I actually think the failure in the test case was on my end, I need to adjust the test casing again, which will be easier with finish products to test against.
