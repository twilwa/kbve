## Notes

### 2024

#### Jam

The jam is coming to an end and I want to thank everyone for helping out with the Travel Game Jam!
This journal entry is a bit short because I did not get a chance to go through and convert all my notes.
The biggest plan is now to prepare for the Discord App Jam!

#### TypeSafety

Okay! I understand the pain of having strict typesafety during a Game Jam but if I can find a way to help migrate that pain from the start, I think we can speed up developement even faster.

My only other take away would be to push changes during the jam faster, keeping the cylce of CI/CD as continuous as possible.
There might be some areas of tooling that I would want to look into, including automatic merging.
