### 2024

<MDXJS>

#### Git

Going to build out another repo for the unity game!
The current issue that I am facing is within the LFS.

```

Use `git lfs logs last` to view the log.
error: external filter 'git-lfs filter-process' failed
fatal: Assets/X/X/X/X/X.png: smudge filter lfs failed
warning: Clone succeeded, but checkout failed.
You can inspect what was checked out with 'git status'
and retry with 'git restore --source=HEAD :/'

```

In this case, I am going to reclone the LFS and build it from scratch.
If everything works out, then I will place the objects into a new repo.
