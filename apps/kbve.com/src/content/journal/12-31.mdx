## Notes

### 2023

- 3:09pm - The final entry to the yearly log! There has been a couple interesting aspects that I wanted to write about but overall its been a great year!

- 6:15pm - Going to migrate the Ruffle aka SWF/Flash Emulator from the `kbve.com` repo as a widget for the AstroVe.
    The original source code for the widget was this below:
    ```html

    <script is:inline src="https://unpkg.com/@ruffle-rs/ruffle"></script>

    <astro-ruffle data-swf={swf} data-className={className}>
        <div id="container" class={className}></div>
    </astro-ruffle>

    <script>
        class AstroRuffle extends HTMLElement {
            constructor() {
                super();

                const swf = this.dataset.swf;
                // Read the message from the data attribute.
                (window as any).RufflePlayer = (window as any).RufflePlayer || {};
                window.addEventListener('load', (event) => {
                    const ruffle = (window as any).RufflePlayer.newest();
                    const player = ruffle.createPlayer();
                    const container = document.getElementById('container');
                    container?.appendChild(player);
                    player.load(swf);
                    player.style.width = "100vw"; 
                    player.style.height = "100vh";
                });
                
            }
        }

        customElements.define('astro-ruffle', AstroRuffle);
    </script>

    ```

    With the Astro props being pass through like this:

    `const { swf = '', className = 'w-full flex overflow-y-hidden' } = Astro.props;`

    Now for this migration of the component, I have to make sure that the SWF is added into the class, if it is not then throw a casual error.

- 11:24pm - I am thinking of using Pascal to generate the js embeds, but since we already have vite inside of the monorepo, I figured it would make sense to expand upon it.
