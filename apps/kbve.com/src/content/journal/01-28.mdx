## Notes

### 2024

    -   9:53am  -   `Refactor`

        #### Refactor

            The `kbve` package has a couple errors that needs to be addressed, which are mainly because the user table has `userid` now instead of `ulid` as a reference.
            
            Issue one would be under the `guild.rs` but now how should I refactor it? 

            For now I am just updating the references to the `ulid` table as `userid`, since we want to make sure the column names match for the inner/left joins.

            However during the `cargo test`, I noticed the holy crate was broken too, which means I need to go back and fix that as well xD!

            The issue with the holy crate would be the observers.
