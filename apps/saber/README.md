#### Assets

- For the magik spells, we used [Sprite Effects Flame Pack](https://craftpix.net/freebies/free-flame-effects-sprite-pack/).
- The Environment and Terrian was provided by [Polytope Studio](https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/35251), huge shout out to Viorel Rai!!
- React UI was inspired by YoRHa / Nier! I will link the credits here in a bit.
