## Holy

This package provides a Getter/Setter, used like this 
    
`#[derive(Getters, Setters)]` or with the crate scoped in, `#[derive(holy::Getters, holy::Setters)]`

Furthermore, we added a visibility handler via attributes, so you can set certain fields visible or private via, `#[holy(public)]` or `#[holy(private)]`

TODO: subscriber / observer.
