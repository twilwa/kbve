## What is KBVE?

KBVE is a collective that builds different programs, libraries and games!
This monorepo is the heart of all our applications, making it easier to manage.

Examples of monorepos:

- [Cal.com](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com)
- [E2B](https://github.com/e2b-dev/e2b/)

Perks of a monorepo include:

- Consistent Developer Environment and Experience.

  - A monorepo can provide a consistent environment and set of tools for all developers, which can be especially beneficial in large organizations with many projects.
  - Easier AI Training, as the codebase is all within a controlled repo.

- Less clutter, keeping a single source of truth.

  - The monorepo acts as a centralized source of truth for all projects, configurations, and dependencies.

- Atomic Changes.

  - Developers can make cross-cutting changes across multiple projects within a single atomic commit.

- Scalable.
  - Modern monorepo build tools and practices are designed to scale, even as the number of projects and developers grows.
